Feature:  Working with tables

  Background:
    Given we are observing the people table

  Scenario: Selecting a row by index
    When we select the table row with index "1"
    Then the row with index "1" should be selected

  Scenario: Selecting a row by value
    When we select the table row with the value "Anna Doe"
    Then the row with index "1" should be selected

  Scenario: Selecting a row by matching cell information
    When we select the table row with the following information:
      | full_name     | date_of_birth |
      | Anna Doe | 3/4/1975      |
    Then the row with index "1" should be selected

  Scenario: Finding a row
    Then we can find the row with the following information:
      | full_name     | date_of_birth | state |
      | John Doe | 12/15/1967    | FL    |

  Scenario: Selecting a row from a child item
    When we select the "1"th table row
    Then the row with index "1" should be selected

  Scenario: Adding rows to the selection
    Given there are a lot of records in a table
    When we add rows "1, 3, 5" to the selection
    Then rows "1, 3, 5" should all be selected

  Scenario: Clearing rows from a selection
    Given there are a lot of records in a table
    When we add rows "2, 3, 4, 5" to the selection
    But we clear rows "2, 4" from the selection
    Then rows "3, 5" should all be selected
    And rows "2, 4" should all not be selected

  Scenario: Clearing a row by matching cell information
    Given we add rows "0, 1" to the selection
    When we clear the table row with the following information:
      | full_name     | date_of_birth |
      | Anna Doe | 3/4/1975      |
    Then the row with index "1" should not be selected

  Scenario: Rows have cells
    Then the row with index "0" should look like the following:
      | Name     | Date of Birth | State |
      | John Doe | 12/15/1967    | FL    |

  Scenario: Retrieving the row values
    Then the table row information should look like the following:
      | text     | row |
      | John Doe | 0   |
      | Anna Doe | 1   |

  Scenario: Retrieving the headers
    Then the table headers are "Full Name, Date of birth, State"

  Scenario: Retrieving a row value by its header
    Then the "date_of_birth" for the row at index "1" is "3/4/1975"

  Scenario: Working with lots of records counts
    When there are a lot of records in a table
    Then the table count responds in a reasonable amount of time

  Scenario: Working with a row when there are a lot of records
    When there are a lot of records in a table
    Then accessing the values in row "12" should be snappy
